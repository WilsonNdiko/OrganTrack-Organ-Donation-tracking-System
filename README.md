## 🏥 **How It Works (Detailed)**

### 📈 **Complete Organ Lifecycle Example**

```
🏥 Patient John Doe passes away
    ↓
🏥 St. Mary's Hospital registers his organs ON OrgFlow
    ↓ (Real-time blockchain tracking begins)
🎨 Heart registered as NFT #100 - Status: "Available"
🩸 Kidney registered as NFT #101 - Status: "Available"
🫀 Cornea registered as NFT #102 - Status: "Available"

    ↓ (Hospital network sees real-time availability)
🏥 City General Hospital checks OrgFlow dashboard
    ↓
🏥 Requests heart via OrgFlow request system
    ↓
🏥 St. Mary's receives request notification
    ↓
🏥 St. Mary's accepts - organ status: "In Transit"
🚑 Transportation team notified with secure instructions
    ↓
🚑 Organ arrives at City General safely tracked
    ↓
🏥 Transplant team updates: "Transplanted"
💚 Patient receives life-saving transplant
    ↓
📋 Complete immutable blockchain record created
    ⏹️ End of lifecycle - zero fraud risk
```

### 🔄 **Real-Time Status Flow**
```
"Available" → "Requested" → "Accepted" → "Transferred" → "Delivered" → "Transplanted"
     1           2              3              4            5              6
```

### 🏢 **Multi-Hospital Coordination**
- **Hospital A** sees all available organs instantly
- **Hospital B** can reserve organs they need
- **Transportation companies** get secure pickup/dropoff details
- **Regulatory bodies** monitor through blockchain transparency
